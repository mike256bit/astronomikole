                <h2>A Special Message for Nicole:</h2>      <p>Hey baby. I started this index and repository so that we can document and explore all the amazing things that we learn. We should use and evolve this space as our skills get better and eventually have a really kick ass website for what <a href="http://www.astronomikole.com" target="_blank">our wedding website</a> should have been. I love you. :)</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Re-up domain</li>
                    <li>Add some fuckin' CSS</li>
                    <li>Make money?</li>
                </ol>
